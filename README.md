# Optical-Character-Recognition-Basic

OCR = Optical Character Recognition. In other words, OCR systems transform a two-dimensional image of text, that could contain machine printed or handwritten text from its image representation into machine-readable text. OCR as a process generally consists of several sub-processes to perform as accurately as possible. The subprocesses are:<br>

Preprocessing of the Image<br>
Text Localization<br>
Character Segmentation<br>
Character Recognition<br>
Post Processing<br>

The sub-processes in the list above of course can differ, but these are roughly steps needed to approach automatic character recognition. In OCR software, itâ€™s main aim to identify and capture all the unique words using different languages from written text characters.

##Tesseract OCR

Tesseract is an open source text recognition (OCR) Engine, available under the Apache 2.0 license. It can be used directly, or (for programmers) using an API to extract printed text from images. It supports a wide variety of languages. 

## Pytesseract and OpenCV

Pytesseract is a wrapper for Tesseract-OCR Engine. It is also useful as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract, as it can read all image types supported by the Pillow and Leptonica imaging libraries, including jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, and others.
